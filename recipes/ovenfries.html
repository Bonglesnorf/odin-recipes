        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These potato fries are a great way to get kids started on learning how to cook. We used this for our "at-home" camp week. We taught the kids how to cook one new recipe each day for an entire week.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, each cut into six wedges</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Arrange potato wedges on a baking sheet; drizzle with olive oil and season with thyme, pepper, and salt. Toss wedges with a spatula to coat evenly.</li>
            <li>Roast potato wedges in the preheated oven for 15 minutes; flip and continue roasting until soft in the center, about 15 minutes more. Transfer wedges to a platter and sprinkle with cheese.</li>
        </ol>
