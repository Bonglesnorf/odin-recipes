        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These potato fries are a great way to get kids started on learning how to cook. We used this for our "at-home" camp week. We taught the kids how to cook one new recipe each day for an entire week.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, each cut into six wedges</li>
