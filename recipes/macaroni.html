        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A three ingredient macaroni and cheese recipe (not including salt and water) developed by <em>J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt</em></p>
        <p>There are a few tricks that make this recipe work such as the minimal use of water which allows the starch from the pasta to be far more concentrated which makes for a creamier sauce</p>
        <p>The other trick is the use of evaporated milk which has powerful emulsifying agents which also contribute to a creamy sauce</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>6 ounces (180ml) evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
